<h1>Seriously, it takes minimal fucking effort to improve this shit.</h1>
<h3>7 fucking declarations.</h3>
<p>That's how much CSS it took to turn that <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">grotesque oile of shit</a> into this easy-to-read masterpiece. It's so fucking
simple and it still has all the glory of the original perfect-ass website:</p>
 
 <ul>
  <li>Shit's <i>still</i> lightweight and loads fast</li>
  <li><i>still</i> fits on all your shitty screens</li>
  <li><i>still</i> looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
  <li>The motherfucker's <i>still</i>  accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li>
  <li>Shit's <i>still</i> legible and gets your fucking point across (if you had one instead of just 5mb pics of hipsters drinking coffee)</li> 
 </ul>
 <h2>And guess what, motherfucker :</h2>
 <p>You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site. Here's how.</p>
 <h1>Let it breath</h1>
 <p>Look at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you're building. Assuming they're not married they probably shouldn't be
 humping. The defaults are trash -- pick a minimum line-height: 1.4 for body copy. Headings should be tighter. If you
 can't see that...piss off.</br>
 </br> 
 If your text hits the side of the browser, fuck off forever. You ever see a book like that? Yes? What a shitty book.</p> 
 
 <h1>A little contrast</h1>
 
 <p>Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life? Tone it down a bit, asshole. I would've even
 made this site's background a nice #EEEEEE if I wasn't so focused on keeping declarations to a lean 7 fucking lines.</p>

 <h1>Size Matters</h1>
 <p>I know your partner says otherwise, but it's true. Bump that body copy to render close to 16px or more. Smaller type
 works well for print, not the screen.</p>
 
 <h1>Line-width, motherfucker</h1>
 
 <p>Looking at an LCD screen is strainful enough. Don't make me read a line of text that's 200 fucking characters long. Keep
 it to a nice 60-80 and users might actually read more than one sentence of your worthless dribble.</p>
 
 <h2>Yes, this is <i> also</i> fucking satire, you fuck</h2>
 
 <p>I love what the creator of <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">this site's inspiration</a> did. What I'm saying is that it's so, so simple to make sites easier
 to read. Websites are broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible, but they're also fucking
 ugly. You and all the other web designers out there need to make them not total shit.</p>
